**Research:** My current focus is on developing advanced techniques for diffusion models to solve general inverse problems, particularly investigating guidance mechanisms, conditioning, and projection methods. I am also exploring universal joint source-channel coding with deep neural networks, with particular interest in their scalability and the underlying scaling laws.

**Previously:**
Before joining BIFOLD, I was actively involved in 6G research at the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz Institute, focusing on neural joint source-channel coding and signal source separation problems.

I earned my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from TU Berlin, where I collaborated with [Peter Jung](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/peter.jung/) and contributed to the field of compressive sensing leveraging priors from deep generative models.

## Research:
Fadli Damara is currently advancing his doctoral research at the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD), within the Probabilistic Modeling and Inference Lab under the guidance of Dr. Shinichi Nakajima. He earned his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from TU Berlin, where he contributed to the field of compressive sensing, utilizing generative priors from models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Before joining BIFOLD, he was actively involved in research at the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Telecommunications, focusing on neural joint source-channel coding and signal source separation problems.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
